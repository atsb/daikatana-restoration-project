# Daikatana Restoration Project

Daikatana restoration aiming to have a clean 1.2 source and to support modern systems.

# Why?

Because the only other project is the Daikatana 1.3 Project, who refuse to release their changes.  I don't care much for formalities, if anyone cared about the source, Eidos would have sued Romero back when he dropped it.  They didn't.

The source archive will be placed here and will be worked on, transparently and contributors are welcome.  Once I've cleaned up the base a bit, I will push the 1.2 sources here and from then on, it will be open for all.

I don't want another 'OldUnreal' situation, where there would eventually be one single person who is the gatekeeper for all.  Daikatana is a decent game and it deserves to have an open community around it.

Let's get to work.
