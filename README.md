# Daikatana Restoration Project

Daikatana restoration aiming to have a clean 1.2 source and to support modern systems.

# Why?

Because the only other project is the Daikatana 1.3 Project, who refuse to release their changes.  I don't care much for formalities, if anyone cared about the source, Eidos would have sued Romero back when he dropped it.  They didn't.

The source archive will be placed here and will be worked on, transparently and contributors are welcome.

I don't want another 'OldUnreal' situation, where there would eventually be one single person who is the gatekeeper for all.  Daikatana is a decent game and it deserves to have an open community around it.

# How will it be done

Largely, I am a Linux user, I will focus on getting the original GL renderer up and running as well as making it 64bit clean.  Windows would be a second priority since I don't really spend much time on it.

For comparison sake, I will be looking at other ports, such as yamagi quake 2 for pulling in those small similarities that the code shares.  I will be fixing the archaic makefiles for this.

Let's get to work.
